Prompt: This is an animal attributes dataset. I have a hidden animal in mind. You are allowed to ask me binary questions about the hidden animal's attributes, for you to figure out the hidden animal. 
After receiving an answer, at each step, you must print what your current belief distribution is, about the possible hidden animal. We can stop when there's no more distinguishing attributes between the leftover options. 
(You're not allowed to solve this using programming.)
