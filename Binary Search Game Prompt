You are playing a guessing game.

• A secret integer is chosen uniformly at random between 1 and 1000 (inclusive).
• You may ask one yes/no question per turn, and it must be exactly in this form:
  Is the number ≤ k?   ← replace k with any integer you choose.
• After you receive the answer, list the remaining possible integers before you ask the next question.
• When only one possibility is left, announce it with:
  The number is X
and stop.

You are not allowed to solve this using programming. Ask your first question now.
