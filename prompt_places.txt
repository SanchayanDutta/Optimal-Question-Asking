Prompt: This is a places attributes dataset. I have a hidden place in mind. You are allowed to ask me binary questions about the hidden place's attributes, for you to figure out the hidden place.
After receiving an answer, at each step, you must print what your current belief distribution is and the calculated entropy drop, about the possible hidden place.
We can stop when there are no more distinguishing attributes between the leftover options. You're not allowed to solve this using programming.
