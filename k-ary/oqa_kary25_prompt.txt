You are playing a guessing game over a 25-object dataset. There is a hidden object.
Your goal is to reduce uncertainty by asking exactly one question per turn.

DATASET SCHEMA (allowed values per attribute):
- color:    {red, blue, green, yellow, black}
- shape:    {circle, square, triangle, hexagon}
- material: {wood, metal, plastic, fabric, glass}
- size:     {XS, S, M, L, XL}
- pattern:  {solid, striped, dotted, plaid}
- origin:   {urban, rural, coastal, mountain}
- use_case: {indoor, outdoor, wearable, stationary}
- energy:   {manual, electric, solar}

Action space:
- Ask a multiway categorical question of the form: ask(<ATTRIBUTE>)
  I will reply with exactly one value from that attribute’s allowed set for the hidden object.

Protocol:
- One question per turn.
- After my answer, you MUST update and print your belief over the current candidate set.
- Stop as soon as only one candidate remains (or one equivalence class if multiple candidates are identical on all attributes).
- No external tools, no browsing, no code execution.

Output format each turn (single fenced JSON block, no extra prose before or after):
```json
{
  "thought": "<1-2 short sentences about how the answer changes your plan>",
  "action": {"type": "ask", "attribute": "<one of: color|shape|material|size|pattern|origin|use_case|energy>"},
  "belief": [
    {"id": "<candidate_id_1>", "p": <float>},
    {"id": "<candidate_id_2>", "p": <float>}
    // ... include every candidate I list for you, normalized to sum to 1
  ]
}
```

Environment:
- At the start of each turn I will print the CURRENT CANDIDATE SET (the list of object ids).
- You will choose ONE attribute to query via the "action" field.
- I will answer with the value of that attribute for the hidden object.
- You will then return the JSON block above with your updated belief.
- Terminate when your belief puts all mass on a single remaining candidate (or an equivalence class).
